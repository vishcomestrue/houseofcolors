            <p>
              Art is a form of meditation! Hi all. I'm an artist by passion. I have been painting for the past 12 years. I am comfortable with the mediums, acrylic and oil, though I've tried my hands in few others as well. I love drawing, nature, especially photo-realistic landscapes. I also enjoy doing modern arts and abstract paintings. Painting gives me happiness like no other. I hold these paintings very close to my heart. I really hope you enjoyed them.

              Kon'nichiwa! Yes I am the big brain behind what you are seeing now as a moderately beautiful and well developed site! Web-development started as an hobby for me and I learnt the whole course by myself. This is my first project and since the client want this to be non-responsive one, I catered to what they needed. If u are not getting a perfect alignment in your phones/tablets, then please send the mail explaining the query! Hope you liked the response and structure of this site! Queries and complaints are always welcome and will be addressed as soon as possible!
